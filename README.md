"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster." Assume good faith. Respect others. **<ins>Don't burn bridges</ins>** (there may not be a second chance, please drop your hubris).

**Strong mentality:** Put your eggs in as many baskets as possible. Contrary to popular belief, you'll not become a 'Jack of all trades, master of none' as this promotes lateral thinking. Plus, this reduces your dependence on people: you develop a mindset that you can wake up <ins>anywhere</ins> and get straight to work.

**Weak mentality:** Being infleunced by the community spirit of tech evangelism in the 2000s, I usually give altruism a chance and don't mind going the extra mile. But if it doesn't pay off and even wreaks havoc upon yourself (Strange, innit? The Eastern world always talk about 'reciprocity' and many great ideas, but how often do they turn into realities?), just don't force yourself and do yourself a favour. **Instead, protect yourself and invest in learning dissimilar things as mentioned. Who knows what the future will be.** If it doesn't pay off, just reach the point of *'nicht geschimpft ist genug gelobt' (even German engineering says that)* and call it a day.

  <p>Lot was dragging his feet. The men grabbed Lot’s arm, and the arms of his wife and daughters—<em>God was so merciful to them!</em>—and dragged them to safety outside the city. When they had them outside, Lot was told, “Now run for your life! Don’t look back! Don’t stop anywhere on the plain—run for the hills or you’ll be swept away.” [...] But Lot’s wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt.</p>
